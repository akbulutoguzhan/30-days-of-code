# Sorting
Given an array, a, of size n distinct elements, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following 3 lines:

Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
First Element: firstElement
where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
Last Element: lastElement
where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
